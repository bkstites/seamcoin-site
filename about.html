      <h2>Bryan Stites</h2>
      <p>I’m a risk management and analytics leader with a background in cybersecurity, fintech systems, and data automation. With a deep interest in equity and access, I created SeamCoin to support collaborative payments among diverse groups—including those without access to traditional banking apps.</p>
      <p>I believe cryptocurrency and smart contracts can be more than speculative assets—they can be tools for social empowerment and inclusion.</p>
