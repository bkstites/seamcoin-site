            <p>Hello! I'm Bryan Stites, a technologist and entrepreneur passionate about leveraging decentralized tools to solve real-world inclusion challenges. With a background in IT risk management, paramedicine, and analytics, I've spent the last decade driving innovations that bridge the gap between people and technology.</p>
            <p>SeamCoin was born from frustration—watching teams struggle to organize simple purchases because someone didn’t have access to PayPal, Venmo, or traditional banks. My goal is to make crypto more human, more accessible, and more useful for the people who need it most.</p>
            <p>When I’m not building solutions like SeamCoin, you’ll find me exploring the intersection of AI, compliance, and community engagement.</p>
